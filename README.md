Hangman Project

The user has 10 incorrect guesses to correctly solve a hangman puzzle. When a user types a key, the key that they typed is stored and displayed on the page for them to keep track. The page does not display repeated guesses regardless of whether they are correct or not. If they user correctly guesses the phrase/word, they can restart the game. The user can also keep track of his or her wins in a session. Likewise, if the user does not successfully guess the phrase, then the program allows the user to restart automatically.

The theme of the hangman program is the TV show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

To do: add style and sound effects to this particular game.
